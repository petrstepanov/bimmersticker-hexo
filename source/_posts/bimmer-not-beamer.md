They name it bimmer, beemer, beamer oh my god! How do we spell it right? This vinyl sticker was released in order to shed the light here.

Originally the correct name for a bmw car is bimmer. BMW motorcycles go by beemers. Beamer is a rudimentary word that should never be used. Period.

The goal of this sticker is to let people know how to pronounce and spell it right. Get the sticker to support the community.

Made of two ORACAL® 651 adhesive glossy vinyl layers. Top "bimmer" layer is white, bottom "not beamer" is made of glossy red vinyl.
