Originally BMW "M" division was originated to carry out the BMW's racing program. "M" letter here stands for word Motorsport. In bimmersticker.store we think about in a different perspective. Built not bought.

Everyone can buy an ///M car. Not everyone though knows how to work in it, take care and modify it the right way. That's why for us M really stands for Modified, not motorprort.

We encourage people to use the sticker on non-M cars too. Because Modified, not Motorsport.

Sticker comes in three different colors. Glossy white, holographic opal (lighter silver-ish color) and holographic blue (darker blue-ish) colors.
