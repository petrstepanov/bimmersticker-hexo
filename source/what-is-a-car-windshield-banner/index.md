## But what exactly are windshield banners and sun strips, and how do they work?

A windshield banner is a strip of vinyl or other material that is applied to the top of your windshield. It typically features a message or design that runs the length of the windshield, making it visible from both the inside and outside of your vehicle. Windshield banners are commonly used to promote a business or organization, advertise a special event, or show support for a sports team.

A sun strip, on the other hand, is a shorter strip of vinyl or other material that is applied to the top of your windshield, just above the driver's line of sight. Sun strips are designed to reduce the amount of sunlight that enters the car, helping to reduce glare and make driving safer and more comfortable.

Both windshield banners and sun strips are easy to install and can be removed without damaging your windshield or leaving any residue behind. They're also weather-resistant and can withstand the elements, making them a durable and long-lasting addition to your vehicle.
